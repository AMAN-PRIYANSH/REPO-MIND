# Progress status

This file is the single source of truth for where the build stands. Claude Code updates it after every task. The supervising assistant updates it when a checkpoint is approved or released.

## Current

- Current checkpoint: **CP7 - End-to-end triage and evidence verifier**
- State: `READY`
- Branch in use: (none yet; the CP7 session records its own `claude/...` branch)
- Specification: [checkpoints/CP7.md](../implementation/checkpoints/CP7.md)

State values: `READY` → `IN_PROGRESS` → (`AWAITING_COLAB` →) `AWAITING_REVIEW` → `APPROVED` (or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).

## Current checkpoint task list

Claude Code: copy the deliverables of the current checkpoint here as a checklist when you start, and tick them as you commit.

(CP7: not started.)

## Handoff notes

Claude Code: if you stop before the checkpoint is complete, write here exactly what is done, what is half-done, and the very next step.

(CP6 was approved on 26 Oct 2026 as a negative result; read the review notes at the end of checkpoints/CP3.md to CP6.md - they bind CP7. The evidence in `data/` is NOT available in a new session: `dataset materialize --set d1` and `--set d4` rebuild it from the committed case lists.)
